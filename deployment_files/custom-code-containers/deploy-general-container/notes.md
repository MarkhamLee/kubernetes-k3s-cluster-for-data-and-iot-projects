### Deploying General Container Workloads 

For one of my projects this is the values file I used to deploy containers I use to monitor a number of smart plugs, so I can see how much power my homelab/associated tinkerings (including this project) are using. This values.yaml file deploys a container per each for the smart plugs I use to monitor my homelab, and can be easily adapted to deploy any container that retrieves data but doesn't receive it on an endpoint. For containers that are running API applications, see the deploy-container-with-ingress folder in the parent folder this folder is contained in.
