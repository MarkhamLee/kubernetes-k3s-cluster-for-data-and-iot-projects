 
## Deploying InfluxDB with Argo CD

This folder contains the umbrella chart and values.yaml file for deploying InfluxDB to Kubernetes via Argo CD. A couple of items to keep in mind:
* You will need to provide an organization name in the values.yaml file
* The secret will be generated by the deployment, and you can retrieve it from Kubernetes storage for logging in. Keep in mind that for reading or writing to InfluxDB, you'll need create a separate API key from within InfluxDB.
* The node affinities are specific to my hardware architecture, so you'll need to update them to fit yours.
