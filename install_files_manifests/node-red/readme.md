My original values.yaml was for Node-Red in HA but it wasn't working very well, you'd update your node types, make a change and then it would disappear or you'd get "something has been updated on the server messages". Obviousy, the three nodes weren't staying in synch very well. Once I moved it to a single node everything was fine. TL/DR this values.yaml file is for a single node deployment it wasn't working well in HA, but if you want to try HA anyway just increase the number of replicas.
